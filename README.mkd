# Ngx CC Pbin Service

This tiny pastebin service is written in python with [bottle](https://bottlepy.org/).

What makes this one different?

Well... It has integration with the #nginx IRC channel. It also doesn't store
any data to disk. The paste is only active until the cache is cleared. this
makes it ideal as a fast service for quick support. It also has extra Nginx
hilighting features.
